# Kenya Public Debt & Economic Sustainability Analysis(2000-2021)
## Project Overview
This project provides a data driven evaluation of Kenya's Fiscal Trajectory over the last 25 years. By intergrating datasets on Public Debt stock, Interest Payments and Annual GDP
the analysis quantifies the actual cost of sovereign borrowing and its relationship to economic growth

The primary goal is to determine the "Effective Interest Rate" of domestic versus foreign debt and assess Kenya's debt Sustainability against 
regional benchmarks like the East African Community (EAC) 60% Debt-to-GDP threshold

## Key Insights
 1. Rising Servicing Costs: Interest Payments Acceleration and high cost of domestic debt servicing.

 3. Sustainability Benchmarking: Tracking the Debt to GDP ratio from 2000 to 2021

## Tech Stack
 Python
 Libraries: Pandas for Data Cleaning
            Matplotlib & Seaborn for Time-series visualization and trend analysis

## Data Sources
1. Public Debt (Ksh Million): Monthly historical data on domestic and external debt stocks
2. Interest Payments: Monthly breakdown of interest paid on domestic and foreign obligations
3. Annual GDP: Yearly figures for Nominal GDP, Real GDP and GDP Growth rates.

## Feature Engineering
To move beyond raw data the following metrics were engineered:
1. Effectiive Interest Rate
2. Debt_to_GDP Ratio

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project follows a rigorous EDA process:
1. Data Cleaning: Convert string to numeric floats and mapping month names to datetime objects
2. Trend Analysis: Visualizing long-term debt accumulation
